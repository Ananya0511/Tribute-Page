                Rani Lakshmi Bai, the queen of Jhansi, Uttar Pradesh. She played a huge role in the revolt 
                of India in 1857. She is still remembered as the bravest queen who fought alone with the 
                Britishers, without fearing anyone. Rani Lakshmi Bai was the leader of the forces who fought 
                against the British. She is one of the greatest freedom fighters in India. The revolt went 
                on for two weeks and Rani Lakshmi Bai led the troop of men and women to fight against the 
                British army.
                <h2><br>The early life of Rani Lakshmi Bai:</br></h2>
                Rani Lakshmi Bai was born on November 19, 1828, in Varanasi, India. Her birth name was 
                Manikarnika Tambe. Her parents were Moropant Tambe and Bhagirathi Sapre. Moropant Tambe 
                was a court Peshwa in Bithoor, he was also named Rani Lakshmi bai ‘chhabili’.Her childhood 
                was a bit different from other girls. She was homeschooled with the boys of Peshwa. What 
                made her childhood different was that she was educated as well as trained in martial arts, 
                horsemanship, sword fighting, shooting, and fencing. With her childhood friends Nana Sahib 
                and Tantia Tope, she learned mallakhamba too.

                <br>In May 1842, she was married to the maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. The name 
                Manikarnika was changed to Lakshmi Bai after marriage. Gangadhar Rao and Rani Lakshmi bai 
                had a son, named Damodar Rao but due to medical conditions, he died after four months of 
                birth. They adopted their cousin Anand Rao and named him Damodar Rao. Just after this, 
                the Maharaja of Jhansi died but before his death he legally adopted his son and made Rani 
                Lakshmi bai the queen, giving her all the powers to rule Jhansi for her lifetime.</br>
                <h2><br>The revolt led by Rani Lakshmi Bai:</br></h2>
                The revolt between the British and Rani Lakshmi Bai started in 1857 when the British tried 
                to get the leadership of Jhansi. The revolt erupted in Meerut. Rani Lakshmi bai was declared 
                the ruler of Jhansi after the death of her husband and Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao. 
                All the Responsibility to save Jhansi was over the shoulder of Rani Lakshmi Bai. She took 
                command of the troops and organized a plan to start the war from Bundelkhand. As the 
                rebellion started, it spread like a forest fire and several other rulers and landlords 
                joined the rebellion. After the revolt, she ruled Jhansi without any intruders till 1858.

                <br>In 1858, Sir Hugh Rose, the commander of the central Indian Field force, declared that 
                if the queen of Jhansi and the troops refuse to leave Jhansi and surrender, they will 
                destroy the whole city. This didn’t affect Rani Lakshmi bai’s bravery. She decided to 
                fight against them and fight for their independence. The troops fought to their last breath 
                but they were overpowered by the enemies. Rani Lakshmi bai didn’t let this affect her 
                courage and she kept on fighting and didn’t surrender. In her whole fight against the 
                British, she got a lot of help from her childhood friend Tantia Tope.</br>

               <br>She escaped the fort with Damodar tied on her back with her horse named Badal. Few of 
               her guards also escaped with her. She went to Kalpi which was later attacked by the British 
               troops and she had to go to Gwalior with her fellow freedom fighters Tantia Tope, Nawab of 
               Banda, and Rao Sahib. In Gwalior, Nana Sahib was made the Peshwa or ruler. Lakshmi Bai 
               warned everybody to stay alert for the attack of the British troops but was not able to 
               convince anyone. The anticipation of Lakshmi Bai was proved right when the British troops 
               attacked Gwalior and were successful to capture Morar.</br>

               <br>Rani Lakshmi Bai fought till the end and didn’t surrender. She was severely injured 
               but refused to surrender. She fought fiercely on the battlefield alone. When there was no 
               other option she decided to burn herself so that the British troops cannot capture her. 
               Her body was cremated by a few locals and her belongings were cremated under a tamarind 
               tree in Gwalior in a huge ceremony. She is one of the greatest examples of fearless and 
               independent women, who fought her battle alone and refused to surrender.</br>
